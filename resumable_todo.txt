ToDo:
	+Get the unit test prep up and working
	+	Finish stubbing in CDCMockInitiator
	+		processMutation
	+	Get back to initial test
	+		testNonResumedGeneralCase -> test out the infra / piping of the logic on the test pieces
	Think about resumability design and doc here:
		Per SyncSegment? That abstraction bubbles out?
		What do we hand out? What kind of class can we wrap that in?
